A very simple Connect Four Game made in Rust

In Connect Four, two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. 
The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four same-colored discs. 

This game allows the player to play computer oppenents of different difficulties.
These computer oppenets work by recursively simulating possible board patterns. Each difficulty looks one move forward.
This exponentially increases the amount of total boards and slows down the program. 

In the Options menu you can change the colour of each players discs.
